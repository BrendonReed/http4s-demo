# Http4sDemo

Created from the http4s [giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template.  Most ideas of what need to happen are in [TODO](./TODO.md)

A fake app I've been looking through to get ideas is a [Todo Backend](https://github.com/mschuwalow/zio-todo-backend/blob/develop/src/main/scala/com/schuwalow/todo/repository/DoobieTodoRepository.scala) which uses http4s + zio + dooby.
